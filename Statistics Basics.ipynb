    "\n",
    "--->Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Mean:\n",
    "Calculation: The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of observations.\n",
    "Use: Provides the average or \"typical\" value in a dataset. It is sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Median:\n",
    "Calculation: The median is the middle value when the dataset is ordered. If there's an even number of observations, it's the average\n",
    "of the two middle values.\n",
    "Use: Less sensitive to extreme values than the mean. Useful when the data has outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Mode:\n",
    "Calculation: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "Use: Identifies the most common value. Some datasets may have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (multimodal), or no mode at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "--->Measures of Variability (Dispersion):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Range:\n",
    "Calculation: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "Use: Provides a simple measure of the spread but is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Variance:\n",
    "Calculation: Variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "Use: Offers a measure of how spread out the values are. However, it is in squared units, so the standard deviation is often preferred\n",
    "for better interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Standard Deviation:\n",
    "Calculation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "Use: Indicates the average distance of data points from the mean. It is in the same units as the original data, making it more interpretable\n",
    "than the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Interquartile Range (IQR):\n",
    "Calculation: The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n",
    "Use: Describes the spread of the middle 50% of the data. Less sensitive to extreme values than the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures collectively provide a comprehensive summary of a dataset. For example, the mean and median offer insights into the center, \n",
    "while the range, variance, standard deviation, and IQR provide information about the spread or dispersion. Using a combination of these \n",
